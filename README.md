* npm v8.1.2 or later (bundled with Node.js)
* MongoDB v5.0 or later ([https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/))
* Git ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads))

### Installation

1. **Clone the BookChat repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Ayyanaruto/BookChat.git
cd BookChat
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Set up MongoDB:**

* Start a MongoDB instance. You can use the default port (27017) or specify a custom port.
* Create a database for BookChat (e.g., `bookchat`).

4. **Configure environment variables:**

* Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following environment variables:

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: These are obtained from the Google API Console when creating a project and enabling Google Sign-In or other Google APIs. You'll find them in the "Credentials" section under "OAuth client IDs".

COOKIE_SECRET: This is used for secure cookie signing in web applications. You should generate a strong, random secret using a tool like openssl rand -base64 32. Don't store it in plain text or in your code.

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_API_KEY, CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_API_SECRET: These are obtained from your Cloudinary account settings or API documentation. They're used to access Cloudinary's image and video management services.

RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET, RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET: These are obtained from your Razorpay account dashboard or API documentation. They're used to integrate Razorpay for online payments in your application.

MONGODB_URI: This is the connection string for your MongoDB database. You can find it in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard or configuration files.

```


### Running the Application

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the `client` directory:

```
cd client
```

2. Install client-side dependencies:

REACT_APP_PROXY= Here add your server Route, Example : http://localhost:3000
